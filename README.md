# Trolley Problem Racing
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021

## Theme
Pick your Poison

## Game Play
Objective: Stop your car by collectin wrenches and hitting people! Wrenches slow you down faster, but are rarer. People are more common, but slow you down less.
Game-play instructions: Move left and right using A and D. Pause the game with E.

## Impediments
We struggled with procedural generating the road, so instead we made a torus of the road and rotated that for the same effect!

## Implementation
Features
 - Fun arcade action
 - Custom 3d assets
 - Fun car experience
 - Life ruining experience for pedestrians
